Intro
==============

This is a collection of miscellaneous java utilities. A small code snippets for xml reading, file transfer, etc. They are not by any means production level of sw - as anyone can tell. I've kept a collection of examples for different purposes to be able to try things fast. A library of basic things is therefore handy to keep in a back pocket.
